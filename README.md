This year again I'll try to write my solutions in Python.

The code is not too nice, but it works :)

Day 5 part two is not an elegant solution, but brute force. 
To make it a bit faster, I split the task into runs on provided ranges.
Start one task per range and find the minimum manually :)

Day 6 need only to calculate the equation of motion and solve a quardratic equation. 
Then the solution need to get fit to integer values.
